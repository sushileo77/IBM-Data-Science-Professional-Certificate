The Project is Based on Determining the Traffic Severity for Car Accidents


Introduction :-
       Road traffic injuries are currently estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death across all age groups globally, and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause  of death by 2030.

        Analysing a significant range of factors, including weather conditions, special events, roadworks, traffic jams among others, an accurate prediction of the severity of the accidents can be performed. 
        These insights, could allow law enforcement bodies to allocate their resources more effectively in advance of potential accidents, preventing when and where a severe accidents can occur as well as saving both, time and money. 

        In addition, this knowledge of a severe accident situation can be warned to drivers so that they would drive more carefully or even change their route if it is possible or to hospital which could have set everything ready for a severe intervention in advance.

         Governments should be highly interested in accurate predictions of the severity of an accident, in order to reduce the time of arrival and thus save a significant amount of people each year. Others interested could be private companies investing in technologies aiming to improve road safeness.
